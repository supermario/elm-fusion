### elm-fusion

Fusion is an experimental mapping tool for Elm.

Fusion lets you explore a HTTP API, and extract not only encoders/decoders, but also `Http.request` code, response mocks, types, etc, dynamically and on the fly.

It is majorly WIP and not ready for sharing.


### Run

Fusion is built entirely with Elm on [Lamdera](https://lamdera.com) and can be run locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:supermario/elm-fusion.git
cd elm-fusion
lamdera live
```

If you're intending to add features, it's nicest with freeze mode turned on.
